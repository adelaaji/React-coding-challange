## Build App

First, run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The project will be built and then exported to HTML files.

The created files will be added to the out folder.
From that folder you can browse the project on your device locally

If you couldn't run the project correctly as an HTML file,
I recommend you to use Live Server extension on VS code.
